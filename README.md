# moai_spriter_plugin

Current version 1.0.1

The Lua plugin for running exported Spriter animations within the Moai SDK game engine.

To run, simply clone this repo as a submodule within your Moai game or project's lua folder,
then include the files in your main.lua and import the exported spriter animation files as shown in the 
sample project (https://github.com/sshukul/MoaiSpriter).

Keeping the module separate as a git submodule will allow you to receive updates directly in your game, 
as newer Spriter features are added.
