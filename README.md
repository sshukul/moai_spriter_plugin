# moai_spriter_plugin

The Lua plugin for running exported Spriter animations within the Moai SDK game engine.

To run, simply clone this repo as a submodule within your Moai game or project's lua folder,
then include the files in your main.lua and import the exported spriter animation files as shown in the 
sample project.

Keeping the module separate as a git submodule will allow you to receive updates as newer Spriter 
features are added.
